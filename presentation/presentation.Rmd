## Introduction

- Community college debate

    - Democratization vs. Diversion (Rouse, 1995)

- Educational outcomes of transfer students (mixed results)  

    - Community college transfer students are less likely to complete a bachelor's degree
        - Doyle (2009)  
        - Long, B. T., & Kurlaender, M. (2009).  
    - Community college transfer students have similar graduation rates as students who started at a four-year institution.
        - Melguizo, Kienzl, & Alfonso (2011)
        - Xu, Jaggars, Fletcher, Fink (2018)

## Research question  

- Are Community College Transfer Students Less Likely to Earn a Bachelor’s Degree than students who started at a 4-year institution?

## Data

- National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 [(NELS:88)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/)  

    - Nationally representative, longitudinal study of 8th graders in 1988.
    - A sample of students followed throughout secondary and postsecondary years. 

- Limitation: restricted data use file

    - Transcript-level data:
        - Number of non-remedial credits earned
        - Credits associated with threshold to identify transfer vs. rising junior
    - Regional data:
        - County-level labor market outcomes
        - Higher education characteristics (e.g. tuition by county)

## Empirical Strategy

### OLS & Probit

$$BA_i = Transfer_i \beta + X_i \gamma + \epsilon$$

- $BA_i$: Bachelor attainment, =1 if the student attained a bachelor’s degree within eight years of high school graduation. 

- $Transfer_i$: Transfer student, =1 for students who first attended a community college and transferred to a four-year college. 

- $X_i$: Individual-specific covariates:

    - Includes individual characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, SES, etc.)
    - High school academic preparation and other characteristics (test scores, bachelor degree expectations, etc.)
    - Financial aid and work related activities (received grant, took out a loan, etc.)
    - Regional characteristics (region of college attended)

## Empirical Strategy

### OLS & Probit

TABLE 2 Differences on Bachelor’s Degree Attainment (OLS & Probit)

![](table2){#id .class width=95% height=95%}


## Empirical Strategy

### PSM

- Individuals might self-select into specific types of institutions based on many observed and unobserved individual characteristics.

- Matching groups of students based on observable pre-treatment characteristics to approximate randomization. 

- Based on strong assumption: all the factors related to college degree attainment were observed and all observed characteristics to match individuals are used in the estimation strategy.

- Propensity scores are estimated using all of the control variables in a probit function.

## Sensitivity analysis

### Confounders

-  Non-random selection in college admission and applicant enrollment decision

    - Affect both institutional selection and academic performance

    - Including, but not limited to: individual ability, ambition, motivation, hard work, academic preparation, maturity, access to resources (e.g. school counselors), and family characteristics

## Sensitivity analysis

### Confounders

- Case 1

  - Z negatively affects D

  - Z positively affects Y

  - Combined that produces bias in the positive direction 
  
  - an observed negative treatment effect would be less negative

- Case 2

  - Z positively affects D

  - Z positively affects Y

  - Combined that produces bias in the negative direction
  
  - an observed negative treatment effect would be more negative


## Sensitivity analysis

### Results 

TABLE 4 Sensitivity Analysis Result

![](sa){#id .class width=100% height=100%} 

- Confounding that explains just 5.21% of the residual variance of transfer and education attainment would eliminate the result entirely; and a confounder explaining just 2.06% would reduce it below converntional levels of statistical significance.

## Sensitivity analysis

### Benchmarking

Socioeconomic status is used as the benchmark variables to bound the relative strength of the unobserved confounders. 

- constructed from a composite of parental education, parental occupation and household income
  
- X ~ D: socioeconomic disparity $\rightarrow$ high school academic preparation $\rightarrow$ type of starting institution
  
- X ~ Y: socioeconomic status $\rightarrow$ family resources, environment $\rightarrow$ academic attainment

:::

- If confounders explain more than three times (twice) the residual variance explained by socioeconomic status, the point estimate (significance level) would be changed.

## Conclusion

- Conventional regression analyses find transfer students are less likely to obtain bachelor’s degrees, holding individual characteristics, high school academic preparation, financial aid and work opportunities, and regional characteristics the same.

- However, the results is likely sensitive to the unobserved confounders. The relationship between transfer and bachelor’s degree attainment can be overturned by even very weak confounders. 
  
- "Sensitivity analyses leave the door open for progress"

  - measure and include confounders?
  
  - other identificaiton strategies? IV?
