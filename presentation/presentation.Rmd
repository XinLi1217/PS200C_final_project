## Introduction

- Community college debate

    - Democratization vs. Diversion 

- Educational outcomes of transfer students (mixed results)  

    - Community college transfer students are less likely to complete a bachelor's degree
        - Doyle (2009)  
        - Long, B. T., & Kurlaender, M. (2009).  
    - Community college transfer students have similar graduation rates as students who started at a four-year institution.
        - Melguizo, Kienzl, & Alfonso (2011)
        - Xu, Jaggars, Fletcher, Fink (2018)

## Research question  

- Are Community College Transfer Students Less Likely to Earn a Bachelor’s Degree than students who started at a Four-year institution?

## Data

- National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 [(NELS:88)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/)  

    - Nationally representative, longitudinal study of 8th graders in 1988.
    - A sample of students followed throughout secondary and postsecondary years. 

- Limitation: restricted data use file

    - Transcript-level data:
        - Number of non-remedial credits earned
        - Credits associated with threshold to identify transfer vs. rising junior
    - Regional data:
        - County-level labor market outcomes
        - Higher education characteristics (e.g. tuition by county)

## Empirical Strategy

### OLS & Probit

$$BA_i = Transfer_i \beta + X_i \gamma + \epsilon$$

- $BA_i$: Bachelor attainment, =1 if the student attained a bachelor’s degree within eight years of high school graduation. 

- $Transfer_i$: Transfer student, =1 for students who first attended a community college and transferred to a four-year college. 

- $X_i$: Individual-specific covariates:

    - Includes individual characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, SES, etc.)
    - High school academic preparation and other characteristics (test scores, bachelor degree expectations, etc.)
    - Financial aid and work related activities (received grant, took out a loan, etc.)
    - Regional characteristics (region of college attended)

## Empirical Strategy

### PSM

- Individuals might self-select into specific types of institutions based on many observed and unobserved individual characteristics.

- Matching groups of students based on observable pre-treatment characteristics to approximate randomization. 

- Based on strong assumption: all the factors related to college degree attainment were observed and all observed characteristics to match individuals are used in the estimation strategy.

- Propensity scores are estimated using all of the control variables in a probit function.

## Sensitivity analysis

Using sensitivity analysis, we can discuss the causal estimates posed by the authors, challenge their assumption of no unobserved confounding, and investigate how confounders might change the research conclusions.

## Sensitivity analysis

### Confounders

-  Non-random selection in college admission and applicant enrollment decision

    - Affect both institutional selection and academic performance

    - Including, but not limited to: individual ability, ambition, motivation, hard work, academic preparation, maturity, access to resources (e.g. school counselors), and family characteristics 
  
- The influence of institutional-level factors is confounded by the nonrandom selection of students into institutions with different qualities.

    - For instance, if highly motivated students self-select themselves into a particular type of institution, then a particular type of institution would seem to be doing a better job of graduating students, even though the true reason for the higher graduation rates is that the institution attracts students who are more likely to graduate (Melguizo, & Dowd, 2009).

## Sensitivity analysis

### Benchmarking

Socioeconomic status, constructed from a composite of parental education, parental occupation and household income, is used as the benchmark variables to bound the relative strength of the unobserved confounders. The benchmark variable was chosen because it is a strong and visible predictor of bachelor’s degree attainment theoretically and empirically (Melguizo et al, 2011; Wang, 2009), and likely explains more of the residual variation than any unobserved confounders.

## Conclusion

- ...

- The relationship between transfer and bachelor’s degree attainment can be overturned by even very weak confounders.
